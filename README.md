# 📡 Task 5: Wireshark – Capturing and Analyzing Network Traffic

## 🎯 Objective
To gain hands-on experience with capturing live network packets and analyzing common protocols using Wireshark.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Wireshark (Free network protocol analyzer)

## 🔍 What Was Done
- Opened Wireshark and started a capture session on my active network interface.
- Browsed a few websites and pinged some servers to generate network traffic.
- Captured traffic was stopped after ~1 minute.
- Applied filters to isolate common protocols like TCP, DNS, and HTTP.
- Exported the capture and documented the findings.

## 📂 Files Included
- `task5_capture.pcapng`: The exported capture file.
- `protocols_report.txt`: Details of the identified network protocols.
- `screenshot.png`: Snapshot of the Wireshark capture session.
- `README.md`: This guide.

## ✅ Outcome
Developed a basic understanding of how different protocols function and how packet-level data can help in troubleshooting networks.
