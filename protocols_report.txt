ðŸ§¾ Protocols Identified from the Capture:

1. **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)
   - Ensures reliable data transfer across the network.
   - Commonly used by HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.

2. **DNS** (Domain Name System)
   - Resolves human-readable domain names like google.com into IP addresses.

3. **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
   - Used for web communication and loading websites.

ðŸ§  Observation:
By applying filters in Wireshark like `tcp`, `dns`, and `http`, I could isolate traffic related to these protocols and better understand how data moves over the internet.
